# Chapter 1: Know Yourself and the World—The Cognitive Starting Point of Investing

> **Key Summary:**
> 
> This chapter systematically explains the cognitive starting point of investing, emphasizing the foundational role of deep self-awareness and understanding the essence of the world in investment decision-making. It covers the multidimensional interpretations of "know yourself" from philosophy, religion, psychology, and modern cognitive science, introduces self-awareness, emotion management, cognitive bias correction, critical thinking, and scientific training methods to help investors improve rationality, stability, and risk resistance. It further proposes building a global perspective, constructing a systematic theoretical framework (macroeconomics, industry trends, company fundamentals, technical analysis, social and technological trends), and emphasizes the effective transformation from theory to practice, comprehensive application of tools and resources, and the construction of multidisciplinary mental models. Finally, it details how to transform cognition into action, establish clear investment goals, risk management, buy/sell signals, periodic reviews, and personalized investment systems, helping investors achieve long-term stable growth and financial freedom.

## 1.1 The Starting Point of Self-Awareness and Investment Wisdom

1.1.1 Know Yourself

The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates inscribed the maxim "Know Thyself" on the pillars of the Temple of Delphi. For thousands of years, this simple yet profound phrase has guided people on the long journey of self-exploration. From ancient times to the present, human self-awareness has deepened—from philosophical contemplation, religious reflection, to modern scientific revelations of brain cognition. Self-knowledge has gradually become the cornerstone for understanding the world and mastering life, especially in the complex and uncertain field of investing.

Humanity's earliest self-awareness originated in philosophy. Eastern and Western sages, though separated by distance, both emphasized the importance of inner awareness:

In ancient Greece, Socrates asserted, "The unexamined life is not worth living," and Plato further advocated the "tripartite soul," emphasizing that reason should govern emotions and desires—mirroring the opposition between rationality and emotion in investment decisions.

In Eastern culture, Laozi advocated "He who knows others is wise; he who knows himself is enlightened," and proposed "The highest good is like water," promoting compliance with natural laws, which in investing means respecting market trends and avoiding fighting the tide.

Buddhism emphasizes "no-self" and "awareness," encouraging people to let go of attachments to external things and view the ups and downs of life with a pure mind—highly consistent with emotional control and risk management in investing.

Beyond philosophical wisdom, religious exploration of self-awareness also provides important insights:

Buddhist meditation encourages "mindfulness" training, observing one's inner emotions, desires, and thoughts. This method can effectively alleviate the impact of greed and fear on decisions, helping investors face market fluctuations more objectively.

Christianity advocates "humility" and "repentance," emphasizing sincere and calm reflection on one's mistakes and shortcomings. This spirit of introspection directly helps investors learn from failures and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of investment decisions.

Ancient wisdom from philosophy and religion offers investors a broader and deeper path to self-awareness. The practice and implementation of this wisdom will be detailed in Chapter 2 "Investment Psychology and Risk Management" and Chapter 9 "Building an Investment System."

With the rise of modern science, our understanding of self-awareness has undergone a major shift. From 19th-century psychological research to breakthroughs in cognitive and neuroscience in the 20th century, humanity has, for the first time, the scientific means to explore self-cognition and emotion:

In psychology, especially the development of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), people can clearly identify their cognitive biases, such as overconfidence, confirmation bias, and loss aversion. These biases are particularly prominent in investing and are major causes of decision-making errors. Through systematic cognitive-behavioral training, investors can better perceive and gradually correct these inherent decision-making mistakes.

The rise of behavioral finance provides investors with a new perspective, revealing the complex interactions between emotions, cognition, and behavior when facing market fluctuations. Understanding these mechanisms significantly enhances investors' ability to resist market noise and strengthens their ability to identify real investment opportunities.

With the rapid development of neuroscience and brain cognition in the 21st century, our self-awareness has entered a scientific era. Cognitive neuroscience research has revealed the neural mechanisms behind decision-making:

The prefrontal cortex, which manages rational thinking and planning, and the amygdala, which manages emotional responses, are in constant competition. When facing dramatic market fluctuations, the emotional center (amygdala) is often overactivated, drowning out the voice of the rational center (prefrontal cortex), leading to irrational investment decisions.

Modern research shows that through mindfulness meditation, critical thinking training, and working memory training (such as Dual N-back), one can effectively enhance the function of the prefrontal cortex and reduce the negative impact of the amygdala on decisions, thereby improving the rationality and stability of investment decisions.
